## The most loved\* ChatGPT extension in VS Code open-sourced

The project is built on the most loved ChatGPT extension [gencay/vscode-chatgpt](https://github.com/gencay/vscode-chatgpt), which has downloaded by ~500,000 developers.

But unfortunately, the original author has decided to stop maintaining the project, and the new recommended Genie AI extension on the original project is not opensourced. So I decided to fork it and continue the development.

## Features

- ‚ûï Use GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT3 or Codex models using your API Key from OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service
- üìÉ Get streaming answers to your prompts in sidebar conversation window
- üî• Stop the responses to save your tokens.
- üìù Create files or fix your code with one click or with keyboard shortcuts.
- ‚û°Ô∏è Export all your conversation history at once in Markdown format.
- Automatic partial code response detection. Continues and combines automatically, when response is cut off.
- Ad-hoc prompt prefixes for you to customize what you are asking ChatGPT
- Edit and resend a previous prompt
- Copy, insert or create new file from the code, ChatGPT is suggesting right into your editor.

## How to install locally

- Install `vsce` if you don't have it on your machine (The Visual Studio Code Extension Manager)
  - `npm install --global vsce`
- Run `vsce package`
- Follow the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix">instructions</a> and install manually.
